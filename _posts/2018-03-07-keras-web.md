title:  How to use Keras inside a web server
---

I got a lot of questions about this topic so I decided to make a tutorial.

## Problem
The problem is that Tensorflow Sessions cannot be shared across processes. So you cannot have a web server that has a reference to your model and call methods on it.
Also, Keras will not tell you what's going on, because it doesn't know. In fact, Tensorflow will just block without error.


## Solution

Your model should only be used by a single worker. Easy enough?

Let's first create a class that will handle our model. It should be thread-safe, because multiple workers will be accessing it.

```python
from keras.applications import VGG16
from multiprocessing import Lock
import numpy as np


class KerasModel():
    def __init__(self):
        self.mutex = Lock()
        self.model = None

    def initialize(self):
        """Initialize our model"""
        self.model = VGG16()
        # Dummy compile
        self.model.compile('sgd', 'mse')

    def predict(self, arr):
        """This method uses VGG16 to predict an ImageNet class.

           arr: Numpy array, the input image (should be of shape (224,224,3))

           returns : A distribution over all 1000 ImageNet's classes.
        """
        if arr.shape != (224, 224, 3):
            raise ValueError('The image provided is not right.')
        with self.mutex:
            # With the mutex, we can now predict!
            return self.model.predict_on_batch(arr[np.newaxis, ...])[0]
```


### Manager
I'll use a [`multiprocessing.Manager`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#managers) to interact with our model. A manager already spawns inside another process and his purpose is do this kind of stuff.

Basically, a Manager is a simple server that provides methods to access its components. In our case, our model is our component.

To let the Manager use our model, we'll need to **register** it.

```python
from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
# Dummy class
class KerasManager(BaseManager):
    pass

KerasManager.register('KerasModel', KerasModel)
```

**That's it!**


### Web server
We can now build our web server! I'll use Flask, because it's super easy to use, but choose the framework of your choice.


Let's initialize our manager :
```python
from keras_model import KerasManager
manager = KerasManager()
manager.start() # Important to start our server!
keras_model = manager.KerasModel()
keras_model.initialize() # Important to initialize our network!
```

It is now ready to be used inside the web server.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello', methods=['POST'])
def hello():
    img = cv2.imdecode(np.fromstring(request.files['file'].read(), np.uint8), -1)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224))
    # With the Manager, we call our model!
    pred = keras_model.predict(img)
    # Get the associated ImageNet class
    return imagenet_classes[np.argmax(pred)]


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Where `imagenet_classes` is the `dict` that we can find [here](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).
Our web server has only one endpoint **hello**, which is a *POST* method that accepts a file with a key `'file'`.
The file is then read using OpenCV. We then feed the network and send back the response.

We can now try it with your favorite request manager. (Like Postman)

## Conclusion
As we can see, it's fairly easy to use a Keras model inside a Web server!
