Hi!
My name is Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, I'm currently an **Applied research scientist at ElementAI** and I did my MSc by Research at **Université de Sherbrooke** with [Pr. Pierre-Marc Jodoin](http://info.usherbrooke.ca/pmjodoin/).

My research is focused on active Learning and uncertainty estimation. I also work on complexity measures, ie. being able to predict the achievable accuracy on a certain dataset without training a deep neural-network.


### Open-Source

At ElementAI, I co-created [BaaL](https://github.com/ElementAI/baal/), an active learning library.

I contribute to many projects such as [Keras](keras.io) or [keras-contrib](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/keras-contrib).

I am member of the Keras-organization. My main contribution is the Sequence API and a total revamp of the input pipeline.
I'm also project manager of [keras-preprocessing](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-preprocessing).


I also built a new library [keras-transform](https://github.com/Dref360/keras-transform) to perform flexible data augmentation.

On this blog, I'll share many of my experiments using Keras and TensorFlow. I'm also using Pytorch for some projects.
