Hi!
My name is Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, I'm currently doing my master at Université de Sherbrooke. My main focus is on localization and segmentation using deep learning! I'm actively contributing to many projects like [Keras](keras.io) or [keras-contrib](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/keras-contrib).

I also built a new library [keras-transform](https://github.com/Dref360/keras-transform) to perform data augmentation easily in any way you want.

On this site, I'll share many of my experiments using Keras and TensorFlow (PyTorch?).

### Interests
* Localization/ segmentation
* Data pipeline
* GANs
* Functional programming

### Where to find me?
In my lab :)

~~I'll be at CVPR 2017 to present a new challenge at [TSWC](tcd.miovision.com) 2017!~~
