Hi!
My name is Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, I'm currently doing a MSc by Research at **Université de Sherbrooke** with [Pr. Pierre-Marc Jodoin](http://info.usherbrooke.ca/pmjodoin/).

My main focus is on localization and segmentation using deep learning. I contribute to many projects like [Keras](keras.io) or [keras-contrib](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/keras-contrib).

I am member of the Keras-organization. My main contribution is the Sequence API and a total revamp of the input pipeline.


I also built a new library [keras-transform](https://github.com/Dref360/keras-transform) to perform flexible data augmentation.

On this site, I'll share many of my experiments using Keras and TensorFlow (PyTorch?).

### Interests
* Localization/ segmentation
* Data pipeline
* GANs
* Functional programming

### Where to find me?
In my lab, University of Sherbrooke (D3-2003)

~~I'll be at CVPR 2017 to present a new challenge at [TSWC](tcd.miovision.com) 2017!~~

~~I'll be at Montreal AI Symposium 2017 to present a poster!~~
