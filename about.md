Hey there!
I'm Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, co-founder of [Baal](https://baal.readthedocs.io) and [Azimuth](https://servicenow.github.io/azimuth). 


As the Founding ML Engineer at Glowstick, I spearheaded the development of advanced intent classification and topic modeling pipelines. I led our company Machine Learning from 0-to-1 and further.

My professional journey has been marked by leadership roles in two significant projects. I directed the development of Azimuth, an open-source error analysis tool that empowers data scientists with comprehensive analytical capabilities. Additionally, I led the creation of Baal, a Bayesian active learning library designed to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications.


I did my MSc with [Pr. Pierre-Marc Jodoin](https://jodoin.github.io/) at USherbrooke working on [object detection](https://tcd.miovision.com/) and [dataset complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07299). 

I'm an advocate for open-source and contribute regularly to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co). I was previously Chair at [Keras](keras.io) and have been published in CVPR, NeurIPS and TMLR. Find me on [Github](https://github.com/Dref360).

You can find a list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ILaXxagAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
