Hi!
My name is Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, I'm currently doing my master at Université de Sherbrooke. My main focus is on localization and segmentation using deep learning! I'm actively contributing to many projects like [Keras](keras.io) or [keras-contrib](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/keras-contrib).

On this site, I'll share many of my experiments using Keras and TensorFlow (PyTorch?).

### Interests
* Localization/ segmentation
* Data pipeline
* GANs
* Functional programming

### Where to find me?

I'll be at CVPR 2017!
