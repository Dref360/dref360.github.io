Hi!
My name is Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, co-founder of [Baal](https://baal.readthedocs.io) and [Azimuth](https://servicenow.github.io/azimuth). I did my MSc with [Pr. Pierre-Marc Jodoin](https://jodoin.github.io/) at USherbrooke working on [object detection](https://tcd.miovision.com/) and [dataset complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07299). 

I'm an advocate for open-source and contribute regularly to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co). I was previously Chair at [Keras](keras.io) and have been published in CVPR, NeurIPS and TMLR. Find me on [Github](https://github.com/Dref360).

You can find a list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pHQH5TcAAAAJ&hl=en).
